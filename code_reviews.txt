1. Both of the code review guidelines have a heavy focus on efficiency and transfer of knowledge. Meaning, both guidelines
cite that the purpose of code reviews is to improve upon efficiency and improve upon the knowledge of coworkers. In terms
of differences, Microsoft seems more focused on maintaining respect and relations between reviewer and reveiwee, while Yelp
does not mention these aspects. Additionally, Microsoft gives a template for how to leverage emojis for efficient code reviews,
while Yelp has no such system in place. The checklist for a review typically consists of "I do believe that my code is strong,
and I have already checked it for flaws" as well as "I am going to communicate what this code does, what is its purpose, I 
need this reviewed by <X> date".
